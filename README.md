# Day-Planner

## The Project

This project is designed to create a day planner for our busy work days to act as a mini-secretary! Simply add your items to the time block, click the save button, and voila! Its saved to local storage and good to go.

## Usage

A very straight forward application, simply type in your item for any given time block, click on the save button to the right, and it's saved to local storage. To edit/change, simply select the text, delete/edit, and save again. This will automatically save the new content in your time block!
